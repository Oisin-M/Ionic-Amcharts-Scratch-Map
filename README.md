# Ionic-Amcharts-Scratch-Map

This is a project using Ionic, React and Amcharts to make a simple scratchmap. It looks as follows:

I chose to use Amcharts since I wanted a library which I could use with React (and therefore Ionic) plus I also wanted a map which contained every country. Amcharts has a very detailed map which does include countries such as the Vatican, Andorra, Liechtenstein etc.

Sadly, I have not continued with this project since it does not run smoothly (noticeable lag between a click and updated image). For a better example of a scratch map, see https://github.com/Oisin-M/Scratch-Map
